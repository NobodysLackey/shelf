### ***User Experience***

#### User Story #1
##### Maria has a huge collection of books, but loves to go to the bookstore to browse for new ones.  She can never remember which one's she already has! She needs an app that easily let's her find or add the books she owns and store the information in an easily accessible place.  This way she can make sure she doesn't own a book before buying!
